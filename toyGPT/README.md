# Building GPT from Scratch

Almost 3 years has passed since the 'transformer' paper came out in the world by researchers in Google and we see now its remarkable milestone, large language model, everywhere in our daily life through versatile service like ChatGPT. I'm not an active developer any more though, it seems to be essential to understand how the basic building block for the remarkable achivement works for my current position as an tech investment manager. so I decide to build my toy GPT from scratch for learning experience.

## Approach - Keep Simple as possible

there are tons of complication for production ready transformer model to consider. but for learning experience I'd like to keep everything as simple as possible. even a noob to python (including myself in the far future) can easily see what's going on inside.
